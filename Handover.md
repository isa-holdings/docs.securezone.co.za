Okay, no problem, I've also got a new secureZone.
I spent some time over the weekend to make the project very extensible when it comes to almost all parts
I added files and documentation to easily update and extend the following

- CSS Framework to use
- Icon Sets to use
- Fonts to Import
- Use Rest or Graphql API
- Render Server Side or Client Side (You will typically render server side when it is a bot from google or bing, otherwise thy won't be able to index anything)
- Compatible with Quasar, Vue 2, Vue 3, Vue CLi
- Unit testing
- Progressive Web App,
- Single Page Web App
- Browser Extension
- Windows App with Electron
- Android and MacOS
- The Web App (Front-end is compatible with Rest or GraphQL)

> The documentation explains in detail the following:
The following Tech is used to dev, host, build and deploy the app:

1. HTML `5`
2. Web Components
3. CSS `3`
4. Sass
5. Windi CSS
6. PHP `7.4`
7. Laravel `8.06`
8. Lighthouse (`GraphQL Lib` for Laravel)
9. CORS (Cross Origin Scripting setup)
10. JavaScript (`ES2016` & `ES2017`)
11. Babel for Transpilling the code down for older browsers
12. JavaScript Modules
13. Vue.js `3`
14. Vue Router
15. Vue Auth Guard
16. Axion (`API Requests`)
17. Vue Templates
18. Custom State Management
19. Web Sockets
20. Browser LocalStorage and SessionStorage
21. Quasar `2`
22. Quasar `Cli`
23. Vite`.js`
24. Markdown for the docs
25. Quasar Server Side Render with `Nuxt` TypeScript
26. Node`.js`
27. NVM (Node version manager)
28. `MySQL` Database
29. `Redis` Caching DB
30. Passport Server side `OAuth2` with web tokens for `SPA`
31. `Yarn` Package Manager for dev dependencies and a `dev` server
32. `NPM` for `global` dependencies
33. `Web Pack` + `Vite` tree shaking, and compiling of app
34. `Composer` PHP Package Manager
35. Apache Webserver
36. CentOS `8`
37. Samba
38. `Git` Version Control

- It sounds like a lot but it's things that's all very familiar to most `dev's` and the `docs` are very detailed and not just in general or copied from the repo, but it is specific to the project as well and I explain everything I implemented.
- Even though this `app` doesn't do much yet, I think the  technology" used will serve well for a long time and it will be upgradeable as well. I do hope to continue working on this, it hooked me now
- I'll let you know when and where you can find all the (Git `Repos`) and how to install the `Mobile apps`, Windows App etc, I'm just finishing up a few details so that whoever continues will have everything they need and where you would typically expect it.
- I also created `Docker` Images for Everything, Ill also send you a link to that, if you just install `docker` on any Linux Dist or Windows with `WSL` (Windows Subsystem for Linux) Installed then you just need to add the Images to Docker and everything works without any hassle or setup.
- Okay that's it for now, I'll let you about what I just mentioned within `24 hours`

> There are some similar docs to this for what I did on Pulse, I'll send everything together
