This repository contains the Apollo Client Browser Devtools extension for Chrome & Firefox.

## 5.7.2 Features

The Apollo Client Browser Devtools appear as an "Apollo" tab in your web browser inspector, alongside other tabs like "Elements" and "Console". The devtools currently have four main features:

- **GraphiQL:** Send queries to your server through your web applications configured Apollo Client instance, or query the Apollo Client cache to see what data is loaded.
- **Watched query inspector:** View active queries, variables, cached results, and re-run individual queries.
- **Mutation inspector:** View fired mutations, variables, and re-run individual mutations.
- **Cache inspector:** Visualize the Apollo Client cache and search through it by field names and/or values.

## 5.7.3 Installation

You can install the extension via [Firefox Browser Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/apollo-developer-tools/) or the [Chrome Webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apollo-client-developer-t/jdkknkkbebbapilgoeccciglkfbmbnfm). If you want to install a local version of the extension instead, skip ahead to the [Developing](#Developing) section.

## 5.7.3.1 Configuration

While your application is in dev mode, the devtools will appear as an "Apollo" tab in your web browser inspector. To enable the devtools for your application in production, pass `connectToDevTools: true` to the ApolloClient constructor in your application. Pass `connectToDevTools: false` if want to manually disable this functionality.

The "Apollo" tab will appear in your web browser inspector if a global `window.__APOLLO_CLIENT__` object exists in your application. Apollo Client adds this hook to the window automatically unless `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production'`. If you would like to use the devtools in production, manually attach your Apollo Client instance to `window.__APOLLO_CLIENT__` or pass `connectToDevTools: true` to the constructor.

If you are seeing the "Apollo" tab but are still having issues, skip ahead to the [Debugging](#Debugging) section.

## 5.7.4 Developing

## 5.7.4.1 Installation

After cloning this repo, install the required packages:

```bash
cd apollo-client-devtools
npm install
```

## 5.7.4.2 Running the sample application

We provide a sample application to run when developing and testing the extension. To run it, install the required dependencies for both the client and server:

```bash
npm run install:dev
```

Then start the application:

```bash
npm run start:dev
```

Navigate to `localhost:3000` to view the application. To view the API schema, navigate to `localhost:4000`.

## 5.7.4.3 Development with web-ext & WebExtWebpackPlugin

For cross-browser development, we rely on the [web-ext](https://github.com/mozilla/web-ext) command line tool and a modified version of the [WebExtWebpackPlugin](https://github.com/hiikezoe/web-ext-webpack-plugin) that hooks into the build process.

To develop with Firefox, run the following command:

```bash
npm run firefox
```

For Chrome, run the following command:

```bash
npm run chrome
```

Running either of these commands will:

- Build and bundle the extension and application
- Use `webpack --watch` to watch source files for changes
- Install the extension in the browser
- Open the targeted browser window to `localhost:3000` (the sample application)
- Rebuild and reload the extension when the source files are changed

Note that even though the extension is rebuilt and reloaded, a hard refresh is still required. Hot reloading is not an option for web extensions.

## 5.7.4.3.1 Development defaults

Defaults can be found and modified in the WebExtPlugin. You might want to do so if you'd like the targeted browser to open to a different address or to turn on `lintOnBuild`.

## 5.7.5 Tests

We use [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and the [React Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro) to write and run our tests.

To run tests for both `src` and `development`, run the following command:

```bash
npm run test
```

You can also run with `--watch` to watch and re-run tests automatically:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

## 5.7.6 Folder structure

There are two main pieces of the Apollo Client Browser Devtools: the extension itself and a React application. The extension is the code that communicates with the browser. It allows us to search an inspected window for an instance of Apollo Client and to create the Apollo tab in the browser's devtools panel. The React application powers the experience in the devtools panel.

The devtools folder structure mirrors this architecture. The source code for the extension can be found in `src/extension`. The React application code can be found in `src/application`.

For builds, we use the `build` folder. After a build, all of the files needed to run the devtools can be found here. If these files are bundled for development, source maps are provided. When these files are bundled for production, source maps are not provided and the code is minified. We use the `dist` folder for distributable zip files.

### ## 5.7.7 Application Structure

The Apollo Client Devtools project is split up by Screens. In the navigation of the Apollo Client Devtools you can select from Explorer, Queries, Mutations and Cache. Each of these Screens has their own React component and is wrapped in a Layout component.

#### ## 5.7.7.1  Explorer:

The Explorer is an Embedded iframe that renders Apollo Studio's Explorer. The Explorer accepts [post messages](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/postMessage) from the dev tools to populate the schema and to communicate network requests and responses. All network requests are done in this app via the parent page's Apollo Client instance. Documentation for all of the configurable properties of the Embedded Explorer can be found in the [studio docs](https://www.apollographql.com/docs/studio/sharing-graphs/#embedding-the-explorer).

#### ## 5.7.7.2 Communication between client & tab

**`hook.ts`** is where we hook into the Apollo Client instance of the parent page and execute operations. In `initializeHook` we set up a communication between the client page and the Apollo Client Devtools tab via an instance of `Relay.ts` using postMessage. The hook sends the tab information from the parent page, such as the queries, mutations & the cache info on this page (from the Apollo Client instance), responses that come back from Devtools-triggered network requests, and when the page is reloading.

**`tabRelay.ts`** is injected into each tab via script tag. Any communication that needs to go from the client to the Apollo Client Devtools need to be forwarded in `tabRelay.ts`.

**`devtools.ts`** is the file where all Apollo Client Devtools communication happens. In this file, network communications for executed operations are forwarded to the Explorer. This is also the file where incoming client messages about the tab state are handled & acted on. Any communication that needs to go from the Apollo Client Devtools to the client needs to be forwarded in `devtools.ts`.

**`explorerRelay.ts`** is a file with a bunch of exported functions that are specific to the Explorer network communications for executed operations. `devtools.ts` uses the functions as callbacks for its incoming messages, and `Explorer.tsx` uses the functions to dispatch network requests & accept responses to display in the embedded Explorer.

#### ## 5.7.7.3 Explorer network communication

When requests are triggered by the user from Explorer, `sendExplorerRequest` in `explorerRelay.ts` dispatches an `EXPLORER_REQUEST` event which is picked up in `devtools.ts` and forwarded to the client. In `hook.ts` the `EXPLORER_REQUEST` message is listened for, and an operation is executed. When a response for this network request is recieved by the client, `EXPLORER_RESPONSE` is sent to the tab by the client in `hook.ts`. This message is forwarded in `tabRelay.ts` to the devtools, which calls `sendResponseToExplorer` which is picked up by `receiveExplorerResponses` called in `Explorer.tsx`.

### ## 5.7.7.4 Debugging

If there is an error in the devtools panel, you can inspect it just like you would inspect a normal webpage.

In Chrome, detach the inspector console from the window (if it's not already detached) by clicking the button with three vertical dots in the upper right corner of the console and selecting the detach option. With the detached console in focus, press `opt-cmd-I` again to open an inspector for the detached console (inspector inception). In this new inspector you will be able to inspect elements in the first inspector, including the devtools panel.

In Firefox, go to `about:debugging`, click on `This Firefox`, find the Apollo Devtool extension and click `Inspect`.

If you are using Apollo Client 2.0, make sure you are using at least version 2.0.5 of the devtools.

If you are using Apollo Client 3.0, make sure you are using at least version 2.3.5 of the devtools.

If you're seeing an error that's being caused by the devtools, please open an issue on this repository with a detailed explanation of the problem and steps that we can take to replicate the error.

## ## 5.7.7.5 Publishing

Release process, for those with permission:

1. Verify that your changes work as expected by loading the extension as an "unpacked extension" locally for each browser.
2. Update the `./package.json` and `./src/extension/manifest.json` version numbers.
3. Commit changes and tag your version as a github release.
4. Publish a new version to npm using `npm publish` in the root of the project. We're publishing to npm to allow other projects to have a dependency on devtools.
5. Run `npm run zip` to pack all of the builds for submission.
6. Create a new release in the Chrome/Firefox web stores (following the instructions for each browser in the sections below), uploading the zip bundle.
