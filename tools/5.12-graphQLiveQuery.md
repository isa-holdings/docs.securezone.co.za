# 5.12 GraphQL Live Queries More info 

[https://github.com/n1ru4l/graphql-live-query](https://github.com/n1ru4l/graphql-live-query) if this is something that we are looking at then also have a look at this [https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-sse](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-sse)

Also have  look at GraphQL WS (Web Socket): [https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws](https://github.com/enisdenjo/graphql-ws)

GraphQL already has a solution for real-time: Subscriptions. Those are the right tool for responding to events. E.g. triggering a sound or showing a toast message because someone poked you on Facebook. Subscriptions are also often used for updating existing query results on a client that consumes data from the same GraphQL API. Depending on the complexity of that data, cache update code for applying the subscription result can eventually become pretty bloated (!!! especially, for adding and removing list items). Often for developers it is more straight-forward to simply refetch the query once a subscription event is received instead of doing cache voodoo magic.

In contrast to manual cache updates using subscriptions, live queries should feel magical and update the UI with the latest data from the server without having to write any cache update wizardry code on the client.

## 5.12.1 Concept

A live query is a query operation that is annotated with a @live directive.

```gql
query users @live {
  users(first: 10) {
    id
    login
  }
}
```

A live query is sent to the server (via a transport that supports delivering partial execution results) and registered. The client receives a immediate execution result and furthermore receives additional (partial) execution results once the live query operation was invalidated and therefore the client data became stale.

The client can inform the server that it is no longer interested in the query (unsubscribe the live query operation).

On the server we have a live query invalidation mechanism that is used for determining which queries have become stale, and thus need to be rescheduled for execution.

Instead of sending the whole execution result, the server can diff the previous and the current execution result and only send a delta instruction to the client instead of the whole operation, resulting in less network overhead!

In a future implementation the server might only need to re-execute partial subtrees of a query operation instead of the whole operation.

## 5.12.2 So why will I need it?

If you have any data that is impotant to be synced to all cliet at exactly the same time and without delay then this is a solution.
This does not work with http requests but with TCP connection between die browser and the server on an open persistent socket. If you think im terms of how LAN games work and you must have your update within 200ms, this is a simular idea, but you just can't play this one... Ony for data send and receive :(
