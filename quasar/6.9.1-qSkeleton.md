6.9.1 QSkeleton

The QSkeleton is a component for displaying a placeholder preview of your content before you load the actual page data. Itâ€™s a nice way of informing the user of what to expect from the page before it is fully loaded and increases the perceived performance. It can be used to incrementally display information on screen as data is being fetched.

This is one of the Predefined types and can be found in the official docs:
