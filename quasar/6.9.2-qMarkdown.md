## 6.9.2 QMarkdown (Vue Plugin, UMD and Quasar App Extension)

QMarkdown is a [Quasar](https://quasar.dev) component. It is a powerful markdown processor that plugs right into your Quasar application.

## 6.9.2.1 Install

```shell
quasar ext add @quasar/qmarkdown
```

When installing the QMarkdown app extension, you will be prompted with two questions:

"Do you want to be able to import markdown (*.md) files?"
The default is true for the above question. It allows you to do this in your Quasar apps:

```js
import markdown from '../examples/myMarkdownFile.md'
```

You can now use the QMarkdown component to process the markdown file to be displayed on your page.

"Do you want to be able to import vue+markdown (*.vmd) files?"
The default is true for the above question. It allows you to do this in your Quasar apps:

```js
import vmd from '../examples/myVuePlusMarkdownFile.vmd'

components: {
  myComponent: vmd
}
```

vmd files also allow you to provide front-matter as part of the processing. Be sure to read the documentation to understand how this works.
