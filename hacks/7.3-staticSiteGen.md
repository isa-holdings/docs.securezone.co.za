# 7.3 Static Site Generator for Documentation

## 7.3.1 With Docsify

> Official Website: [Docsify Website](https://docsify.js.org/)

**Install Docsify**

```shell
npm i docsify-cli -g
```

Then browse to the root of you docs, the README.md will server as you index file

Run the following command

```shell
docsify init
```

Done, docsify actually generates the html output on the fly so you don't have to keep on running `init` after every change, you can simply just keep on adding files.

## 7.3.2.3 How to Install the Admin plugin

```shell
 bin/gpm install admin
```

This will automatically install the admin plugin plus its dependency plugins (login, email, form)

After this simply point your browser to your Grav installation and you will be prompted to create a new admin user.

## 7.3.2.4 How to Update

> Please update Grav first!, and then the other plugins...

If you are using the admin plugin, you can simply Update Grav itself from the notice. You can click the Update button to update plugins and themes. If you don't see any updates, you can clear the GPM cache by click the Check for Updates button in the top-right.

Updating is now a simple affair. Simply navigate to the root of the Grav install in your terminal and type:

```shell
bin/gpm selfupgrade -f
```

This will upgrade the Grav core to the latest version. Additionally, you should update all your plugins and themes to the latest version (including the admin plugin if you have that installed).

You can do this using the command below:

```shell
bin/gpm update -f
```
