## 7.3.3 How to Install the Admin plugin

```shell
 bin/gpm install admin
```
This will automatically install the admin plugin plus its dependency plugins (login, email, form)

After this simply point your browser to your Grav installation and you will be prompted to create a new admin user.

## 7.3.4 How to Update

> Please update Grav first!, and then the other plugins...

If you are using the admin plugin, you can simply Update Grav itself from the notice. You can click the Update button to update plugins and themes. If you don't see any updates, you can clear the GPM cache by click the Check for Updates button in the top-right.

Updating is now a simple affair. Simply navigate to the root of the Grav install in your terminal and type:

```shell
$ bin/gpm selfupgrade -f
```

This will upgrade the Grav core to the latest version. Additionally, you should update all your plugins and themes to the latest version (including the admin plugin if you have that installed).

You can do this using the command below:

```shell
bin/gpm update -f
```
