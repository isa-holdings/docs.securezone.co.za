# 7.2 Laravel 8 CORS

Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS) is a mechanism that allows restricted resources on a web page to be requested from another domain outside the domain from which the first resource was served.

# 7.2.1 CORS Middleware 

Along with new app installation, config/cors.php file also generated. Laravel allows following cors related configurations.

- CORS configuration paths
- Allowed methods
- Allowed origins patterns
- Allowed headers
- Exposed headers
- Max age
- Supports credentials

```php
<?php

return [

    /*

    |
    | Here you may configure your settings for cross-origin resource sharing
    | or "CORS". This determines what cross-origin operations may execute
    | in web browsers. You are free to adjust these settings as needed.

    'paths' => ['api/*'],
    'allowed_methods' => ['*'],
    'allowed_origins' => ['*'],
    'allowed_origins_patterns' => [],
    'allowed_headers' => ['*'],
    'exposed_headers' => [],
    'max_age' => 0,
    'supports_credentials' => false,
];
```

# 7.2.2 Malevolent Laravel CORS Error

No `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header is present on the requested resource.), it occurred because we have two different domain trying to exchange data with each other. And yes we havenâ€™t even enabled the `CORS` yet.

```error
Access to XMLHttpRequest at 'http://localhost:8000/demo-url' from origin 'null' 
has been blocked by CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is 
present on the requested resource.
```

The best thing with CORS for dev is to just add wildcards for all he CORS rules:

```php
// config/cors.php

return [

    /*
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------
    | Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) Configuration
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------

    | or "CORS". This determines what cross-origin operations may execute
    | in web browsers. You are free to adjust these settings as needed.

    'paths' => ['*'],                           // `/api` or `/client`..

    'allowed_methods' => ['*'],                 // GET AND POST works nby default but the rest of the restFull ones does not( Put , patch...)

    'allowed_origins' => ['*'],                 // Comma separated list of oringins

    'allowed_origins_patterns' => ['*'],        // Regex of domains or origins that can make requests

    'allowed_headers' => ['*'],                 // This is where i'm stuck now between this one and the next one, for now its just a wildcard until I need to look this up

    'exposed_headers' => ['*'],                 // Specify any custom headers you are using

    'max_age' => 0,                             // The browser does not have to check the rules with every request. But whe it is set to 0 it will, otehrwize you can change that value to 60 and it will only check if there were any changes every inute

    'supports_credentials' => false             // Does i require you to have auth credentials in the header to be able to request the resource
];

```
CORS has left me stumped more than once but finally it is now standard on Laravel 7+ and you can just use the wildcard. So problem solved :)
`PS: Before you go to production you better fix CORS`
