# 3.13 User Permission Through Roles

Laravel Passport – Working with Authentication, Scope, and Permission

## Define User Permission Through Role

The first step is defining the role of particular users. We are going to use 3 different permission i.e. admin, moderator and basic. These roles help to authenticate the user for desired actions

- **admin** – A user with admin permission can Add, Edit and View the user’s list.
- **moderator** – A user with moderator permission can Edit and View the user’s list.
- **basic** – A user with basic permission can only view the user’s list.

The first step is to create a migration for users and roles. We are going to use the make:model command that will create the model and the migration for us. Let’s create the role migration and run the migration to add the roles table.

```shell
php artisan make:model -m Role
```
