# 9.1 Make API

This is my own invention here, in the next document (9.2) I'm adding a function to generate UUID's. I could have just gone and added it to the global properties like this

```json
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

// "async" is optional;
// more info on params: https://v2.quasar.dev/quasar-cli/boot-files
export default boot(async ({ app }) => {

app.config.globalProperties.$uuid = uuidv4;
```

This I could go anywhere and simply say `let id = this.$uuid()` and that would generate a UUID and gets assigned to `id`

But that would look feel wrong to access a property by getting a function back that just generated and ID, so I created the make / object function.

The make function

```json
export default boot(async ({ app }) => {
  // Adds an object called make to the global properties
  if (!app.config.globalProperties.make) {
    app.config.globalProperties.make = {};
  }

  // Adds make function to app, so now you can call app.make()
  app.prototype.$make = (key, callback) => {
    app.config.globalProperties.make[key] = callback;
  }
  
  // app.make adds a function to the globalProperties.make object that makes something
});
```

Now when adding the UUID function to I say app.make('uuid',uuid);

I can then use this function anywhere by saying `this.$make.uuid()`;

This syntax checks that I don't overwrite previous declared function and it's clear now that I'm going to make something and not requesting the value of a property

I'm sure I'll find a lot more things I might want to in the future, them I simply say app.make('functionName',callback);
